#OBSERVATIONS:-

#We observe that there are patterns as shown by the auto-correlation plot which are periodic i.e there is a seasonal pattern observed 
#There are peaks and trough
#For a particular year, the values start decreasing from month of January i.e during initial period till July and from month of August the values start increasing till the end of the the year.
#This is a monthly time series as the frequency is 12

#Central Tendency

#•	What are the min, max, mean, median, 1st and 3rd Quartile values of the times series?

#FIRST QUARTILE :- 92.05
#Third Quartile :- 106.45

#•	Show the box plot. 
boxplot.stats(candy_ts)
boxplot(candy_ts ,data=candy_ts, main = "Boxplot of Candy Production In US")
boxplot(traindata ,data=traindata, main = "Boxplot of Candy production Training Values")
#•	Can you summarize your observation about the time series from the summary stats and box plot? 
#Box plots are a measure of how well distributed is the data in a data set. It divides the data set into three quartiles. Based on the summary stats and box plot, we can easily locate the minimum as well as maximum value of production values. 77.02 is the minimum value whereas 130.29 is the maximum value.. There are few outliers in the data set as visible in the plot.
#For the box plot of train data, there are no outliers in the plot 



##Decomposition

#•	Plot the decomposition of the time series.
stl_decomp <- stl(candy_ts,s.window ="periodic")
stl_decomp
plot(stl_decomp)
attributes(stl_decomp)


#•	Is the times series seasonal?
#Yes it is the pattern repeats at regular interval of time

#•	Is the decomposition additive or multiplicative? 
ValueComp <- decompose(candy_ts)
ValueComp
plot(ValueComp)
attributes(ValueComp)

#The decomposition is "additive"

#•	If seasonal, what are the values of the seasonal monthly indices? 
# 1.2410256  , 0.7698196 , -2.1072758 , -6.9767092 , -10.2914152,  -9.6690272,
#-10.0910383  , -2.5757128  , 3.3183237 , 10.9408659 , 12.0913524 , 13.3497913

#•	For which month is the value of time series high and for which month is it low?
max(ValueComp$figure) #December highest
min(ValueComp$figure) # May lowest
#The value is highest in December and lowest in May

#•	Can you think of the reason behind the value being high in those months and low in those months?

#In December, its winter season and its also the holiday season, with christmas being celebrated widely across the nation. Weather and humidity can also play a prominent role in the process of making candy, as it can have a dramatic impact on the quality of the finished product.As a rule of thumb, candy is made when the weather is cool and dry, as the candy will cool faster and reduce the likelihood of crystal formation. Demand of candies laso increase during this holiday season and hence the chances of making profits are high. During Month of May as the humidity increases and with the onset of summer it becomes the worst time to manufacture candies, with the heat those get melted and desired results may not be obtained and hence the production is decreased.

#•	Show the plot for time series adjusted for seasonality. Overlay this with the line for actual time series? Does seasonality have big fluctuations to the value of time series? 

plot(candy_ts)
lines(seasadj(stl_decomp), col="Red")
lines(seasadj(ValueComp), col="Red")

#Yes, seasonality does not have big fluctuations to the value of timeseries
